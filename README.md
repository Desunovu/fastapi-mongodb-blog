   - Develop models for users, articles, and comments using SQLAlchemy.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Configure the connection to the MongoDB database using SQLAlchemy.

4. **Create API**:
   - Use FastAPI to build the top-level API.

5. **Implement GraphQL**:
   - Utilize Strawberry to create a GraphQL schema and define the necessary queries and mutations for data operations.

6. **Add Functionality**:
   - Implement the ability to search for articles, paginate through the content, and filter articles by tags.

7. **Frontend Development**:
   - Create a simple interface using React to display articles and comments.

8. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for the API to ensure its correctness and reliability.

9. **Documentation**:
   - Generate API documentation using FastAPI tools to facilitate its usage by other developers.

10. **Optimization**:
    - Optimize database queries and overall application performance.

11. **Deployment and Publication**:
    - Deploy the application on a server and make it publicly accessible.
